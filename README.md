## 📌 Project Description

The **Car Price Predictor** uses a trained **Linear Regression** model to estimate car prices from historical data. Users can input car details through a web form, and the application instantly predicts the expected selling price.

This project is ideal for beginners learning:

* Machine Learning deployment
* Flask web development
* Model serialization using Pickle
* Real‑world regression use cases

---

## 🔥 Features
